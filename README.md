# Platform Science Coding Exercise

To begin, please download the zipped code to your local machine or clone the repository
```
https://github.com/arcanerogue/driver-assignments.git
```

Ensure the Gradle JDK is set to version 11 under **Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Gradle**

Build the project to download the dependencies.

Once the app is launched, driver assignments will be determined and a list of driver cards will be displayed. 

Clicking on each driver will expand the card to reveal the assigned shipment.
